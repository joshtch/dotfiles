# TODO: create a script that watches a local html file and, when changes
# are made to the file, views the file in Chrome, either opening a new tab with
# the URL or switching to the first open tab that matches and refreshing that
# page

# Use fswatch to watch the desired files, specified on the command line
fswatch -o "$@" | xargs -n1 -I {} osascript -e 'fill this in'

# This is an AppleScript obtained from here: https://gist.github.com/mayoff/1138816
# that can handle finding, focusing, and refreshing an open tab that matches
# a specific URL, or open a new tab if no matching tab exists.
# This needs to be executed by the above command, but in such a way that it
# can generate the correct URLs based on the information set on the command
# line.
